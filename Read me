when i was first introduced to Git hub i was clueless about it. to be honest i created the account because i was told every devolper must have one abd thats when i created it.But i am willing to practice and master it like the back of my palm,i have to! i am looking forward to everything that we will be doing and i hope my best of my ability is the "best of the ability" needed in this program.
